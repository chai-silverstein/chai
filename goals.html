          <li>I admire people who can take logic and art and create something useful.</li>
          <li>I want to have a flexible career.</li>
          <li>I find myself working jobs that have steep learning curves but no room for personal growth.</li>
          <li>I can't wait to find an environment of like-minded people so that we may grow together.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
